# Annotation Guidelines â€“ RealWorldScenes-50

These guidelines ensure consistency and quality in annotations across all dataset images.

## Classes and Rules

### 1. Person
- Annotate full human body if visible.
- If partially visible, annotate only visible parts.
- Ignore shadows or reflections.

### 2. Food
- Annotate clearly visible food items.
- Ignore packaging if food is not visible.
- Avoid labeling food in advertisements or menus unless in real context.

### 3. Vehicle
- Annotate full outline of cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles.
- Ignore vehicles that are less than 50% visible.
- Exclude toys or models unless they are the main object.

### 4. Animal
- Annotate all visible animals (domestic or wild).
- Ignore animals that are less than 10x10 pixels in size.
- Do not annotate statues or pictures of animals.

### 5. Electronic Device
- Annotate clearly visible devices like mobile phones, laptops, tablets, cameras, TVs.
- Exclude devices if they are unclear or mostly hidden.

- Avoid labeling duplicates (e.g., reflections in mirrors, shadows).
- Maintain consistent labeling across similar scenes.
